It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.

2897|For the truth of the conclusions of physical science, observation is the supreme Court of Appeal. It does not follow that every item which we confidently accept as physical knowledge has actually been certified by the Court our confidence is that it would be certified by the Court if it were submitted. But it does follow that every item of physical knowledge is of a form which might be submitted to the Court. It must be such that we can specify (although it may be impracticable to carry out) an observational procedure which would decide whether it is true or not. Clearly a statement cannot be tested by observation unless it is an assertion about the results of observation. Every item of physical knowledge must therefore be an assertion of what has been or would be the result of carrying out a specified observational procedure.|Sir Arthur Eddington

2911|It is a commonplace that the history of civilisation is largely the history of weapons. In particular, the connection between the discovery of gunpowder and the overthrow of feudalism by the bourgeoisie has been pointed out over and over again. And though I have no doubt exceptions can be brought forward, I think the following rule would be found to be generally true that ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance. Thus, for example, tanks, battleships and bombing planes are inherently tyrannical weapons, while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon --so long as there is no answer to it-- gives claws to the weak.|George Orwell

In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe.

To die, to sleep To sleep perchance to dream ay, there's the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.|William Shakespeare

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths, Our bruised arms hung up for monuments, Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.

But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them,-- Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, Have no delight to pass away the time, Unless to spy my shadow in the sun.|William Shakespeare

5809|Although prepared for martyrdom, I preferred that it be postponed.|Winston Churchill

5812|Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening, ever-ascending, ever-improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the journey. But this, so far from discouraging, only adds to the joy and glory of the climb.|Winston Churchill
5813|I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.|Winston Churchill

5817|It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.|Winston Churchill
5818|Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.|Winston Churchill

5821|Personally I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught.|Winston Churchill
5822|One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half.|Winston Churchill
5823|Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.|Winston Churchill
5824|It is a mistake to try to look too far ahead. The chain of destiny can only be grasped one link at a time.|Winston Churchill
5825|I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.|Winston Churchill
5826|Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.|Winston Churchill
5827|When I am abroad, I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country. I make up for lost time when I come home.|Winston Churchill
5828|We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.|Winston Churchill
5829|When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber.|Winston Churchill
5830|The reserve of modern assertions is sometimes pushed to extremes, in which the fear of being contradicted leads the writer to strip himself of almost all sense and meaning.|Winston Churchill
5831|The British nation is unique in this respect. They are the only people who like to be told how bad things are, who like to be told the worst.|Winston Churchill
5832|There are a terrible lot of lies going around the world, and the worst of it is half of them are true.|Winston Churchill
5833|Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy and the lash.|Winston Churchill
5834|We shall not fail or falter we shall not weaken or tire...Give us the tools and we will finish the job.|Winston Churchill
5835|Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt... We shall not fail or falter we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools and we will finish the job.|Winston Churchill
5836|I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.|Winston Churchill

5838|For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.|Winston Churchill
5839|I am prepared to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.|Winston Churchill
5840|I am reminded of the professor who, in his declining hours, was asked by his devoted pupils for his final counsel. He replied, 'Verify your quotations.'|Winston Churchill
5841|It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations. Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is an admirable work, and I studied it intently. The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts. They also make you anxious to read the authors and look for more.|Winston Churchill
5842|So they the Government go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.|Winston Churchill
5843|One day President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once 'The Unnecessary War'.|Winston Churchill

5847|From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.|Winston Churchill

5852|Our greatest glory consists not in never failing, but in rising every time we fall.|Vincent Van Gogh
5853|Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.|Vincent Van Gogh
5854|If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it. I think that I see something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning and coos or laughs because it sees the sun shining on its cradle.|Vincent Van Gogh
5855|How can I be useful, of what service can I be There is something inside me, what can it be|Vincent Van Gogh
5856|One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever come to sit by it. Passersby see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on the way.|Vincent Van Gogh
5857|A good picture is equivalent to a good deed.|Vincent Van Gogh
5858|What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?|Vincent Van Gogh
5859|It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to. . . . The feeling for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures.|Vincent Van Gogh
5860|It is better to be high-spirited even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all to prudent.|Vincent Van Gogh
5861|If one is the master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time insight into and understanding of many things.|Vincent Van Gogh

5872|Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.|Aldous Huxley
5873|We are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found, and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself.|Aldous Huxley
5874|Consistency is contrary to nature, contrary to life. The only completely consistent people are dead.|Aldous Huxley
5875|The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles and mysteries. Nor did they posses a really effective system of mind-manipulation. Under a scientific dictator, education will rea|Aldous Huxley
5876|You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but now, as yet, intelligent enough.|Aldous Huxley
5877|Experience teaches only the teachable.|Aldous Huxley
5878|My fate cannot be mastered it can only be collaborated with and thereby, to some extent, directed. Nor am I the captain of my soul I am only its noisiest passenger.|Aldous Huxley
5879|After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.|Aldous Huxley
5880|Abused as we abuse it at present, dramatic art is in no sense cathartic it is merely a form of emotional masturbation. It is the rarest thing to find a player who has not had his character affected for the worse by the practice of his profession. Nobody can make a habit of self-exhibition, nobody can exploit his personality for the sake of exercising a kind of hypnotic power over others, and remain untouched by the process.|Aldous Huxley
5881|One of the great attractions of patriotism -- it fulfills our worst wishes. In the person of our nation we are able, vicariously, to bully and cheat. Bully and cheat, what's more, with a feeling that we are profoundly virtuous.|Aldous Huxley
5882|The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that, from age to age, nothing changes and yet everything is completely different.|Aldous Huxley
5883|Experience is not what happens to a man it is what a man does with what happens to him.|Aldous Huxley

5887|There's only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.|Aldous Huxley
5888|Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.|Aldous Huxley
5889|The vast majority of human beings dislike and even dread all notions with which they are not familiar. Hence it comes about that at their first appearance innovators have always been devided as fools and madmen.|Aldous Huxley
5890|Art is one of the means whereby man seeks to redeem a life which is experienced as chaotic, senseless, and largely evil.|Aldous Huxley
5891|The finest works of art are precious, among other reasons, because they make it possible for us to know, if only imperfectly and for a little while, what it actually feels like to think subltly and feel nobly.|Aldous Huxley
5892|A man's worst difficulties begin when he is able to do as he likes.|Aldous Huxley
5893|Idealism is the noble toga that political gentlemen drape over their will to power.|Aldous Huxley
5894|When one's ill or unhappy, one needs something outside oneself to hold one up. It is a good thing, I think, when one has been knocked out of one's balance . to have some external job or duty to hang on to.|Aldous Huxley

5905|An intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex.|Aldous Huxley
5906|At least two-thirds of our miseries spring from human stupidity, human malice and those great motivators and justifiers of malice and stupidity idealism, dogmatism and proselytizing zeal on behalf of religous or political ideas.|Aldous Huxley
5907|Happiness is not achieved by the conscious pursuit of happiness it is generally the by-product of other activities.|Aldous Huxley
5908|The Establishment center ... has led us into the stupidest and cruelest war in all history. That war is a moral and political disaster -- a terrible cancer eating away at the soul of our nation.|George McGovern
5909|It doesn't require any particular bravery to stand on the floor of the Senate and urge our boys in Vietnam to fight harder, and if this war mushrooms into a major conflict and a hundred thousand young Americans are killed, it won't be U. S. Senators who die. It will be American soldiers who are too young to qualify for the senate.|George McGovern

5912|Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5913|Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves ... Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point it, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps, then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5914|This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love the more they give, the more they possess.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5915|Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see each other whole against the sky.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5916|Do continue to believe that with your feeling and your work you are taking part in the greatest the more strongly you cultivate this belief, the more will reality and the world go forth from it.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5917|Live your questions now, and perhaps even without knowing it , you will live along some distant day into your answers.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5918|For one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5919|Live the questions.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5920|If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it blame yourself, tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5921|Do not assume that she who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. Her life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, she would never have been able to find these words.|Rainer Maria Rilke
5922|For one human being to love another human being That is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task|Rainer Maria Rilke

5927|Why love if losing hurts so much We love to know that we are not alone.|Clive Staples Lewis
5928||
5929|Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.|Clive Staples Lewis
5930|Friendship is not necessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value rather it is one of those things that give value to survival.|Clive Staples Lewis
5931|What I want to fix your attention on is the vast overall movement towards the discrediting, and finally the elimination, of every kind of human excellence -- moral, cultural, social or intellectual. And is it not pretty to notice how 'democracy' (in the incantatory sense) is now doing for us the work that was once done by the most ancient dictatorships, and by the same methods The basic proposal of the new education is to be that dunces and idlers must not be made to feel inferior to intelligent and industrious pupils. That would be 'undemocratic.' Children who are fit to proceed may be artificially kept back, because the others would get a trauma by being left behind. The bright pupil thus remains democratically fettered to his own age group throughout his school career, and a boy who would be capable of tackling Aeschylus or Dante sits listening to his coeval's attempts to spell out A CAT SAT ON A MAT. We may reasonably hope for the virtual abolition of education when 'I'm as good as you' has fully had its way. All incentives to learn and all penalties for not learning will vanish. The few who might want to learn will be prevented who are they to overtop their fellows And anyway, the teachers -- or should I say nurses -- will be far too busy reassuring the dunces and patting them on the back to waste any time on real teaching. We shall no longer have to plan and toil to spread imperturbable conceit and incurable ignorance among men.|Clive Staples Lewis
5932|Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.|Clive Staples Lewis
5933|Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another What You, too Thought I was the only one.|Clive Staples Lewis
5934|Prosperity knits a man to the world. He thinks he's 'finding his place in it,' while really it is finding its place in him.|Clive Staples Lewis
5935|What seem our worst prayers may really be, in God's eyes, our best. Those, I mean, which are least supported by devotional feeling. For these may come from a deeper level than feeling. God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when he catches us, as it were, off our guard.|Clive Staples Lewis
5936|Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.|Clive Staples Lewis
5937|The safest road to hell is the gradual one-the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.|Clive Staples Lewis
5938|Some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith but they are afflictions, not sins. Like all afflictions, they are, if we can so take them, our share in the passion of Christ.|Clive Staples Lewis
5939|A man who is eating or lying with his wife or preparing to go to sleep in humility, thankfulness and temperance, is, by Christian standards, in an infinitely higher state than one who is listening to Bach or reading Plato in a state of pride.|Clive Staples Lewis
5940|The Future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.|Clive Staples Lewis
5941|The perfect church service would be the one we were almost unaware of our attention would have been on God. But every novelty prevents this. It fixes our attention on the service itself and thinking about worship is a different thing than worshipping ... 'Tis mad idolatry that makes the service greater than the god.|Clive Staples Lewis
5942|Just a hurried line...to tell a story which puts the contrast between *our* feast of the Nativity and all this ghastly Xmas racket at it's lowest. My brother heard a woman on a 'bus say, as the 'bus passed a church with a Crib outside it, Oh Lor' They bring religion into everything. Look- they're dragging it even into Christmas now|Clive Staples Lewis
5943|When we lose one blessing, another is often, most unexpectedly, given in its place.|Clive Staples Lewis
5944|Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important.|Clive Staples Lewis
5945|I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.|Clive Staples Lewis
5946|If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth - only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair.|Clive Staples Lewis
5947|It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present in us.|Clive Staples Lewis
5948|Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements.|Clive Staples Lewis
5949|Friendship is...the sort of love one can imagine between angels.|Clive Staples Lewis
5950|We may not be able to get certainty, but we can get probability, and half a loaf is better than no bread.|Clive Staples Lewis
5951|I was not born to be free. I was born to adore and to obey.|Clive Staples Lewis
5952|The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.|Helen Keller
5953|When one door of happiness closes, another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.|Helen Keller
5954|No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.|Helen Keller

5957|Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything good in the world.|Helen Keller
5958|The world is moved not only by the mighty shoves of the heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.|Helen Keller
5959|Security is mostly superstition. It does not exist in nature Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often as the bold.|Helen Keller
5960|I have always thought it would be a blessing if each person could be blind and deaf for a few days during his early adult life. Darkness would make him appreciate sight silence would teach him the joys of sound.|Helen Keller
5961|The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight, but has no vision.|Helen Keller
5962|Literature is my Utopia. Here I am not disenfranchised. No barrier of the sense shuts me out from the sweet, gracious discourse of my book friends. They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness.|Helen Keller

5968|Although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it.|Helen Keller
5969|I seldom think about my limitations, and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers.|Helen Keller
5970|I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.|Helen Keller
5971|It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers, but for powers equal to our tasks, to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal.|Helen Keller
5972|It is better to be happy for a moment and be burned up with beauty than to live a long time and be bored all the while.|Helen Keller
5973|One's life story cannot be told with complete veracity. A true autobiography would have to be written in states of mind, emotions, heartbeats, smiles and tears not in months and years, or physical events. Life is marked off on the soul by feelings, not by dates.|Helen Keller
5974|Not the senses I have but what I do with them is my kingdom.|Helen Keller
5975|There is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his.|Helen Keller

5977|Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.|Helen Keller
5978|Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. Security does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than exposure.|Helen Keller
5979|One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.|Helen Keller
5980|Science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all - the apathy of human beings.|Helen Keller
5981|We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough.|Helen Keller
5982|Toleration is the greatest gift of mind, it requires that same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle.|Helen Keller
5983|Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are, we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men. It then appears that we are among the privileged.|Helen Keller
5984|Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. 'Light Give me light' was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.|Helen Keller
5985|I thank God for my handicaps, for through them, I have found myself, my work and my God.|Helen Keller
5986|There is plenty of courage among us for the abstract, but not for the concrete.|Helen Keller
5987|Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousand of miles and all the years you have lived.|Helen Keller
5988|Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.|Helen Keller
5989|People do not like to think. If one thinks, one must reach conclusions. Conclusions are not always pleasant.|Helen Keller

Not understand that America is God's crucible, the great melting-pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming Here, you stand, good folk, think I, when I see them at Ellis Island, here you stand in your fifty groups, with your fifty languages and histories, and your fifty blood hatreds and rivalries...|Israel Zangwill

6094|Nicky I think in all fairness, I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do. For instance tomorrow morning ill get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and... walk in and see and uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll... crack your f***in' head wide-open in front of everybody in the bank. And just about the time I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma. And guess what I'll split your f***in' head open again. 'Cause I'm f***in' stupid. I don't give a f*** about jail. That's my business. That's what I do.|Casino
6095|Ace In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers.

I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.|Casino
6096|Ace Running a casino is like robbing a bank with no cops around. For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's like a morality car wash.|Casino
6097|Ace The town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing|Casino
6098|Nicky A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. But you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise, you're talking about a half-hour to forty-five minutes worth of digging. And who knows who's gonna come along in that time Pretty soon, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all f***in' night.|Casino
6099|Ace When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.|Casino

6167|It seems to me the book has not just aesthetic values-- the charming little clothy box of the thing, the smell of the glue, even the print, which has its own beauty. But there's something about the sensation of ink on paper that is in some sense a thing, a phenomenon rather than an epiphenomenon.

6175|Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize it, than to accept life unquestioningly. Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems nasty, painful, evil, can become a source of beauty, joy and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such.|Henry Miller

6189|One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.|Henry Miller
6190|Living apart and at peace with myself, I came to realize more vividly the meaning of the doctrine of acceptance.

7480|There is much pleasure ot be gained from useless knowledge.|Bertrand Russell
7481|Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education.|Bertrand Russell

7484|War does not determine who is right - only who is left.|Bertrand Russell
7485|The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.|Bertrand Russell
7486|In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.|Bertrand Russell
7487|Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.|Bertrand Russell
7488|The thing that I should wish to obtain from money would be leisure with security.|Bertrand Russell
7489|Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.|Bertrand Russell
7490|Education, which was at first made universal in order that all might be able to read and write, has been found capable of serving quite other purposes. By instilling nonsense it unifies populations and generates collective enthusiasm.|Bertrand Russell
7491|Real life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity.|Bertrand Russell
7492|A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation.|Bertrand Russell
7493|So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.|Bertrand Russell
7494|The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.|Bertrand Russell
7495|The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.|Bertrand Russell
7496|The main thing needed to make men happy is intelligence.|Bertrand Russell
7497|Fear is, I believe, a most effective tool in destroying the soul of an individual--and the soul of a people.|Bertrand Russell
7498|One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by instructions as to the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power.|Bertrand Russell
7499|The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.|Bertrand Russell

7503|Nothing of importance is ever achieved without discipline.

7504||
7505|Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise.|Bertrand Russell
7506|The happiness that is genuinely satisfying is accompanied by the fullest exercise of our faculties and the fullest realization of the world in which we live.|Bertrand Russell
7507|When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others.|Bertrand Russell
7508|Drunkenness is temporary suicide.|Bertrand Russell
7509|It may seem to your conceited to suppose that you can do anything important toward improving the lot of mankind. But this is a fallacy. You must believe that you can help bring about a better world. A good society is produced only by good individuals, just as truly as a majority in a presidential election is produced by the votes of single electors. Everybody can do something toward creating in his own environment kindly feelings rather than anger, reasonableness rather than hysteria, happiness rather than misery.|Bertrand Russell
7510|'Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.|Bertrand Russell

7513|One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.|Bertrand Russell
7514|Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.|Bertrand Russell
7515|It is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents us from living freely and nobly.|Bertrand Russell
7516|If all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give.|Bertrand Russell
7517|Man needs, for his happiness, not only the enjoyment of this or that, but hope and enterprise and change.|Bertrand Russell
7518|The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.|Bertrand Russell

7520|It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living.|Bertrand Russell
7521|To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.|Bertrand Russell
7522|It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it so seldom achieves great results. The wish to preserve the past rather than the hope of creating the future dominates the minds of those who control the teaching of the young.|Bertrand Russell
7523|I found one day in school a boy of medium size ill-treating a smaller boy. I expostulated, but he replied 'The bigs hit me, so I hit the babies that's fair.' In these words he epitomized the history of the human race.|Bertrand Russell
7524|The fundamental defect of fathers is that they want their children to be a credit to them.|Bertrand Russell
7525|Our instinctive emotions are those that we have inherited from a much more dangerous world, and contain, therefore, a larger portion of fear than they should.|Bertrand Russell
7526|The mind is a strange machine which can combine the materials offered to it in the most astonishing ways.|Bertrand Russell
7527|I think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt. I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.|Bertrand Russell
7528|Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day.|Bertrand Russell
7529|If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence.|Bertrand Russell
7530|In the part of this universe that we know there is great injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked prosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying.|Bertrand Russell
7531|If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years.|Bertrand Russell
7532|All movements go too far.|Bertrand Russell
7533|A stupid man's report of what a clever man says can never be accurate, because he unconciously translates what he hears into something he can understand.|Bertrand Russell
7534|It is a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won't go.|Bertrand Russell
7535|Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth -- more than ruin -- more even than death.... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.|Bertrand Russell
7536|Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.|Bertrand Russell
7537|Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.|Bertrand Russell
7538|Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.|Bertrand Russell
7539|Passive acceptance of the teacher's wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes man to seek and to accept a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position.|Bertrand Russell
7540|It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.|Bertrand Russell
7541|No one gossips about other people's secret virtues.|Bertrand Russell
7542|Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man.|Bertrand Russell
7543|The people who are regarded as moral luminaries are those who forego ordinary pleasures themselves and find compensation in interfering with the pleasures of others.|Bertrand Russell
7544|The main things which seem to me important on their own account, and not merely as means to other things, are knowledge, art, instinctive happiness, and relations of frendship or affection.|Bertrand Russell
7545|The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.|Bertrand Russell
7546|Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.|Bertrand Russell
7547|The good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life. I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy - I mean that if you are happy you will be good.|Bertrand Russell
7548|The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf.|Bertrand Russell
7549|This is one of those views which are so absolutely absurd that only very learned men could possibly adopt them.|Bertrand Russell
7550|What the world needs is not dogma but an attitude of scientific inquiry combined with a belief that the torture of millions is not desirable, whether inflicted by Stalin or by a Deity imagined in the likeness of the believer.|Bertrand Russell
7551|There is no nonsense so errant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate governmental action.|Bertrand Russell
7552|Too little liberty brings stagnation and too much brings chaos.|Bertrand Russell
7553|This is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.|Bertrand Russell
7554|Not to be absolutely certain is, I think, one of the essential things in rationality.|Bertrand Russell
7555|There are two motives for reading a book one, that you enjoy it the other, that you can boast about it.|Bertrand Russell
7556|Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men although he was twice married, it never occured to him to verify this statement by examining his wives' mouths.|Bertrand Russell
7557|Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact.|Bertrand Russell
7558|When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others. It is much more nearly certain that we are assembled here tonight than it is that this or that political party is in the right. Certainly there are degrees of certainty, and one should be very careful to emphasize that fact, because otherwise one is landed in an utter skepticism, and complete skepticism would, of course, be totally barren and completely useless.|Bertrand Russell
7559|Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.|Bertrand Russell
7560|The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.|Bertrand Russell
7561|One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways.|Bertrand Russell
7562|To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.|Bertrand Russell
7563|We have, in fact, two kinds of morality side by side one which we preach but do not practice, and another which we practice but seldom preach.|Bertrand Russell
7564|It is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatsoever for supposing it is true.|Bertrand Russell
7565|It is obvious that 'obscenity' is not a term capable of exact legal definition in the practice of the Courts, it means 'anything that shocks the magistrate.'|Bertrand Russell
7566|Man is a credulous animal, and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones.|Bertrand Russell

7599|He saw a lawyer killing a viper On a dunghill hard, by his own stable And the devil smiled, for it put him in mind Of Cain and his brother, Abel.|Samuel Taylor Coleridge
7600|The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions - the little, soon forgotten charities of a kiss or a smile, a kind look or heartfelt compliment.|Samuel Taylor Coleridge
7601|Language is the armory of the human mind, and at once contains the trophies of its past and the weapons of its future conquests.|Samuel Taylor Coleridge

9265|To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull facilities can comprehend only in the most primitive forms--this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the ranks of the devoutly religious men.|Albert Einstein
9266|Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for insects as well as for the stars. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.|Albert Einstein
9267|I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb. Perhaps two-thirds of the people of the Earth might be killed, but enough men capable of thinking, and enough books, would be left to start again, and civilization could be restored.|Albert Einstein
9268|Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world.|Albert Einstein
9269|Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.|Albert Einstein
9270|Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. It is characteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong. In order to illustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I remarked that only a supranational organization would offer protection from that danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race|Albert Einstein
9271|Human beings are not condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.|Albert Einstein
9272|All our thoughts and concepts are called up by sense-experiences and have a meaning only in reference to these sense-experiences. On the other hand, however, they are products of the spontaneous activity of our minds they are thus in no wise logical consequences of the contents of these sense-experiences. If, therefore, we wish to grasp the essence of a complex of abstract notions we must for the one part investigate the mutual relationships between the concepts and the assertions made about them for the other, we must investigate how they are related to the experiences.|Albert Einstein
9273|There was this huge world out there, independent of us human beings and standing before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partly accessible to our inspection and thought. The contemplation of that world beckoned like a liberation.|Albert Einstein
9274|Never regard study as a duty but as an enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later works belong.|Albert Einstein
9275|I have reached an age when, if someone tells me to wear socks, I don't have to.|Albert Einstein
9276|If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.|Albert Einstein
9277|All of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field.|Albert Einstein
9278|A photograph never grows old. You and I change, people change all through the months and years, but a photograph always remains the same. How nice to look at a photograph of mother or father taken many years ago. You see them as you remember them. But as people live on, they change completely. That is why I think a photograph can be kind.|Albert Einstein
9279|True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist.|Albert Einstein
9280|Those people have seen something. What it is I do not know and I can not care to know. (on flying saucers)|Albert Einstein
9281|The mere formulation of a problem is far more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skills. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science.|Albert Einstein
9282|Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us closer to the secret of the 'Old One.' I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice.|Albert Einstein
9283|Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.|Albert Einstein
9284|The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity.|Albert Einstein
9285|We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.|Albert Einstein
9286|Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.|Albert Einstein
9287|Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.|Albert Einstein
9288|He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead his eyes are closed.|Albert Einstein
9289|How strange is the lot of us mortals Each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.|Albert Einstein
9290|I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.|Albert Einstein
9291|An empty stomach is not a good political advisor.|Albert Einstein
9292|In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.|Albert Einstein
9293|Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.|Albert Einstein
9294|More and more I come to value charity and love of one's fellow being above everything else... All our lauded technological progress--our very civilization--is like the axe in the hand of the pathological criminal.|Albert Einstein
9295|The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead his eyes are closed.|Albert Einstein
9296|What is the meaning of human life, or of organic life altogether To answer this question at all implies a religion. Is there any sense then, you ask, in putting it I answer, the man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.|Albert Einstein
9297|The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious - the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science.|Albert Einstein
9298|I do not believe in the immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern without any superhuman authority behind it.|Albert Einstein
9299|Any power must be an enemy of mankind which enslaves the individual by terror and force, whether it arises under the Fascist or the Communist flag. All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded to the individual.|Albert Einstein
9300|The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.|Albert Einstein
9301|Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.|Albert Einstein
9302|...One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.|Albert Einstein
9303|If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.|Albert Einstein
9304|Why does this magnificent applied science, which saves work and makes life easier, bring us little happiness The simple answer runs because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it.|Albert Einstein
9305|In light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alterations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light -- only those who have experienced it can understand it.|Albert Einstein
9306|I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts the rest are details.|Albert Einstein
9307|You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.|Albert Einstein
9308|Every kind of peaceful cooperation among men is primarily based on mutual trust and only secondarily on institutions such as courts of justice and police.|Albert Einstein
9309|If I were to start taking care of my grooming, I would no longer be my own self ... so the hell with it ... I will continue to be unconcerned about it, which surely has the advantage that I'm left in peace by many a fop who would otherwise come to see me.|Albert Einstein
9310|I like neither new clothes nor new kinds of food.|Albert Einstein
9311|It would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it. (referring to clothing)|Albert Einstein
9312|If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture, let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies.|Albert Einstein
9313|There is an atmosphere of well-sounding oratory that likes to attach itself to dress clothes. Away with it|Albert Einstein
9314|A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe,' a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.|Albert Einstein
9315|If a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign|Albert Einstein
9316|The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.|Albert Einstein
9317|There comes a time when the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but can never prove how it got there.|Albert Einstein
9318|Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors, concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods--in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.|Albert Einstein
9319|I believe that whoever tries to think things through honestly will soon recognize how unworthy and even fatal is the traditional bias against Negroes. What can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice He must have the courage to set an example by words and deed, and must watch lest his children become influenced by racial bias.|Albert Einstein
9320|Bias against the Negro is the worst disease from which the society of our nation suffers.|Albert Einstein
9321|The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.|Albert Einstein
9322|I feel that you are justified in looking into the future with true assurance, because you have a mode of living in which we find the joy of life and the joy of work harmoniously combined. Added to this is the spirit of ambition which pervades your very being, and seems to make the day's work like a happy child at play. (referring to America)|Albert Einstein
9323|A theory can be proved by experiment but no path leads from experiment to the birth of a theory.|Albert Einstein
9324|The American lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European. Life for him is always becoming, never being.|Albert Einstein
9325|The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.|Albert Einstein
9326|As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable.|Albert Einstein
9327|If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it|Albert Einstein
9328|Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.|Albert Einstein
9329|If A equals success, then the formula is A equals X plus Y plus Z. X is work. Y is play. Z is keep your mouth shut.|Albert Einstein
9330|I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker. The example of great and pure individuals is the only thing that can lead us to noble thoughts and deeds. Money only appeals to selfishness and irresistibly invites abuse. Can anyone imagine Moses, Jesus or Ghandi armed with the money-bags of Carnegie|Albert Einstein
9331|Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.|Albert Einstein
9332|Gravitation can not be held responsible for people falling in love.|Albert Einstein
9333|My religion consists of a humble admiration of the unlimitable superior who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.|Albert Einstein
9334|The wirless telegraph is not difficult to understand. The ordinary telegraph is like a very long cat. You pull the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angeles. The wireless is the same, only without the cat.|Albert Einstein
9335|Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings admiring, asking and observing, there we enter the realm of Art and Science.|Albert Einstein
9336|Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are not even capable of forming such opinions.|Albert Einstein
9337|The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.|Albert Einstein
9338|When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.|Albert Einstein
9339|Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.|Albert Einstein
9340|Since I do not foresee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace. Perhaps it is well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear, it would not do.|Albert Einstein
9341|Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.|Albert Einstein
9342|Too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves.|Albert Einstein
9343|Of what significance is one's one existence, one is basically unaware. What does a fish know about the water in which he swims all his life The bitter and the sweet come from outside. The hard from within, from one's own efforts. For the most part I do what my own nature drives me to do. It is embarrassing to earn such respect and love for it.|Albert Einstein
9344|The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.|Albert Einstein
9345|You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this And radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.|Albert Einstein
9346|Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.|Albert Einstein
9347|It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.|Albert Einstein
9348|Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.|Albert Einstein
9349|Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.|Albert Einstein
9350|There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.|Albert Einstein
9351|The difference between what the most and the least learned people know is inexpressibly trivial in relation to that which is unknown.|Albert Einstein
9352|Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.|Albert Einstein
9353|Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything one learned in school.|Albert Einstein
9354|We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us.|Albert Einstein
9355|One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.|Albert Einstein
9356|Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.|Albert Einstein
9357|Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the Gods.|Albert Einstein
9358|As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.|Albert Einstein
9359|Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity.|Albert Einstein
9360|Generations to come will find it difficult to believe that a man such as Gandhi ever walked the face of this earth.|Albert Einstein
9361|Not until we dare to regard ourselves as a nation, not until we respect ourselves, can we gain the esteem of others, or rather only then will it come of its own accord.|Albert Einstein
9362|I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.|Albert Einstein
9363|Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.|Albert Einstein
9364|The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.|Albert Einstein
9365|A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.|Albert Einstein
9366|Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.|Albert Einstein
9367|The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.|Albert Einstein
9368|God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.|Albert Einstein
9369|A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.|Albert Einstein
9370|Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.|Albert Einstein
9371|We cannot dispair of humanity, since we are ourselves human beings.|Albert Einstein
9372|Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical equation stands forever.|Albert Einstein
9373|No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong.|Albert Einstein
9374|Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.|Albert Einstein
9375|Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.|Albert Einstein
9376|How I wish that somewhere there existed an island for those who are wise and of goodwill In such a place even I would be an ardent patriot.|Albert Einstein
9377|The fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears, for there's no risk of accident for someone who's dead.|Albert Einstein
9378|The state exists for man, not man for the state. The same may be said of science. These are old phrases, coined by people who saw in human individuality the highest human value. I would hesitate to repeat them, were it not for the ever recurring danger that they may be forgotten, especially in these days of organization and stereotypes.|Albert Einstein
9379|The physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of the theoretical foundations for he himself knows best and feels most surely where the shoe pinches.... he must try to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified... The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.|Albert Einstein
9380|As long as Nazi violence was unleashed only, or mainly, against the Jews, the rest of the world looked on passively and even treaties and agreements were made with the patently criminal government of the Third Reich.... The doors of Palestine were closed to Jewish immigrants, and no country could be found that would admit those forsaken people. They were left to perish like their brothers and sisters in the occupied countries. We shall never forget the heroic efforts of the small countries, of the Scandinavian, the Dutch, the Swiss nations, and of individuals in the occupied part of Europe who did all in their power to protect Jewish lives.|Albert Einstein
9381|Since that deluge of newspaper articles I have been so flooded with questions, invitations, suggestions, that I keep dreaming I am roasting in Hell, and the mailman is the devil eternally yelling at me, showering me with more bundles of letters at my head because I have not answered the old ones.|Albert Einstein
9382|My pacifism is an instinctive feeling, a feeling that possesses me because the murder of men is disgusting. My attitude is not derived from any intellectual theory but is based on my deepest antipathy to every kind of cruelty and hatred.|Albert Einstein
9383||
9384|I have become rather like King Midas, except that everything turns not into gold but into a circus.|Albert Einstein
9385|The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.|Albert Einstein
9386|The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.|Albert Einstein
9387|The only real valuable thing is intuition.|Albert Einstein
9388|The point is to develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide the child over to important fields for society. Such a school demands from the teacher that he be a kind of artist in his province.|Albert Einstein
9389|In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.|Albert Einstein
9390|The Lord God is subtle, but malicious He is not.|Albert Einstein
9391|The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unhappy but hardly fit for life.|Albert Einstein
9392|It is not the fruits of scientific research that elevate man and enrich his nature. but the urge to understand, the intellectual work, creative or receptive.|Albert Einstein
9393|The crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a perparation for his future career.|Albert Einstein
9394|Do not worry about your problems in mathematics. I assure you, my problems with mathematics are much greater than yours.|Albert Einstein
9395|The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.|Albert Einstein
9396|Relativity applies to physics, not ethics.|Albert Einstein
9397|Common sense is that layer of prejudices which we acquire before we are sixteen.|Albert Einstein
9398|A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depends on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the measure as I have received and am still receiving.|Albert Einstein
9399|I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.|Albert Einstein
9400|I don't know how man will fight World War III, but I do know how they will fight World War IV with sticks and stones.|Albert Einstein
9401|Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not one bit simpler.|Albert Einstein
9402|The most beautiful and most profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science. So to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that which is impenetretrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their primitive forms-this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness.|Albert Einstein
9403|If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.|Albert Einstein
9404|Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -how passionately I hate them|Albert Einstein
9405|It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.|Albert Einstein
9406|God may be subtle, but He isn't mean.|Albert Einstein
9407|If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal. Not to people or things.|Albert Einstein
9408|The true measure of a man is the degree to which he has managed to subjugate his ego.|Albert Einstein
9409|Imagination is more important than knowledge...|Albert Einstein
9410|Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. Truth is what stands the test of experience.|Albert Einstein
9411|If I had only known, I would have been a locksmith.|Albert Einstein
9412|I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.|Albert Einstein
9413|Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.|Albert Einstein
9414|The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.|Albert Einstein
9415|Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.|Albert Einstein
9416|The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. The trite subjects of human efforts, possessions, outward success, luxury have always seemed to me contemptible.|Albert Einstein
9417|My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.|Albert Einstein
9418|Laws alone can not secure freedom of expression in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be spirit of tolerance in the entire population.|Albert Einstein

9439|All these souls, after they have passed away a thousand years, are summoned by the divine ones in great array, to the lethean river. . .In this way they become forgetful of the former earthlife, and re-visit the vaulted realms of the world, willing to return again into living bodies.|Virgil

9733|Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual.

This is the condition of children and barbarians, in which instinct has learned nothing from experience.|George Santayana

9756|Just because the solutions of problems are not visible at any particular time does not mean that those problems will never be alleviated -- or confined to tolerable dimensions. History has a way of changing the very terms in which problems operate and of leaving them, in the end, unsolved, to be sure, yet strangely deflated of their original meaning and importance.|M. I.

For it is only with the god enthroned in the innermost shrine of the other, that the god hidden in me, will consent to appear.|Felix Adler
9870|The conception of worth, that each person is an end per se, is not a mere abstraction. Our interest in it is not merely academic.

A human being is not to be handled as a tool but is to be respected and revered.|Felix Adler

Our place and the place of the entire world system is to praise and exalt God. When people of the Bible caught a glimpse of Him, their lives were changed. Perhaps our lives remain stagnate because we do not spend enough time looking at Him.|Roger Anderson

10435|Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self, in which case, it is best that the garment be loose, a little like the robes of the desert, through which one's nakedness can always be felt, and, sometimes, discerned. This trust in one's nakedness is all that gives one the power to change one's robes.|James Arthur Baldwin
10436|Freedom is not something that anybody can be given Freedom is something that people take and people are as free as they want to be.|James Arthur Baldwin

10449|Character builds slowly but it can be torn down with incredible swiftness.|Faith Baldwin
10450|The instinct to command others, in its primitive essence, is a carnivorous, altogether bestial and savage instinct. Under the influence of the mental development of man, it takes on a somewhat more ideal form and becomes somewhat ennobled, presenting itself as the instrument of reason and the devoted servant of that abstraction, or political fiction, which is called the public good. But in its essence it remains just as baneful, and it becomes even more so when, with the application of science, it extends its scope and intensifies the power of its action. If there is a devil in history, it is this power principle.|Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bakunin

10452|I have always felt that the moment when first you wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the 24 hours. No matter how weary or dreary you may feel, you possess the certainty that ... absolutely anything may happen. And the fact that it practically always doesn't , matters not one jot. The possibility is always there.|Monica Baldwin

10458|I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it, and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't.|Lucille Ball
10459|Knowing what you can not do is more important than knowing what you can do. In fact, that's good taste.|Lucille Ball
10460|One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesn't pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself.|Lucille Ball

10573|Imagination has brought mankind through the dark ages to its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination has given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine, and the automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities. So I believe that dreams--daydreams, you know, with your eyes wide open and your brain machinery whizzing--are likely to lead to the betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman most apt to invent, and therefore to foster, civilization.|L. Frank Baum
10574|The skylines lit up at dead of night, the air-conditioning systems cooling empty hotels in the desert, and artificial light in the middle of the day all have something both demented and admirable about them the mindless luxury of a rich civilization, and yet of a civilization perhaps as scared to see the lights go out as was the hunter in his primitive night.|Jean Baudrillard

10590|When humans participate in ceremony, they enter a sacred space. Everything outside of that space shrivels in importance. Time takes on a different dimension. Emotions flow more freely. The bodies of participants become filled with the energy of life, and this energy reaches out and blesses the creation around them. All is made new everything becomes sacred.|Sun Bear

But when you come home at night with only the shattered pieces of your hopes and dreams, he can mend them like new with two magic words Hi, Dad|Alan Marshall Beck
10609|A little girl can be sweeter (and badder) oftener than anyone else in the world. She can jitter around, and stomp, and make funny noises that frazzle your nerves, yet just when you open your mouth she stands there demure with that special look in her eyes. A girl is Innocence playing in the mud, Beauty standing on its head, and Motherhood dragging a doll by the foot.|Alan Marshall Beck
10610|A girl becomes a wife with her eyes wide open. She knows that those sweetest words, 'I take thee to be my wedded husband,' really mean, 'I promise thee to cook three meals a day for 60 years thee will I clean up after thee will I talk to even when thou art not listening thee will I worry about, cry over and take all manner of hurts from.'|Alan Marshall Beck

11288|The ideal life is in our blood and never will be still.

11500|Morality, taken as apart from religion, is but another name for decency in sin. It is just that negative species of virtue which consists in not doing what is scandalously depraved and wicked.

11555|For Scripture is the school of the Holy Spirit, in which, as nothing is omitted that is both necessary and useful to know, so nothing is taught but what is expedient to know.

11556|The sum is, that the worship of God must be spiritual, in order that it may correspond with His nature.

11559|The Fanaticism which discards the Scripture, under the pretense of resorting to immediate revelations is subversive of every principle of Christianity.

11572|Indeed, the Founders mentioned the pagan authors in so many heartfelt speeches, pamphlets and letters that today's sweeping references to America's 'Christian' roots and 'Judeo-Christian heritage' ought to be amended. Maybe these terms should be reserved to explain the traditional religions and morality of individuals, families, congregations, small communitities. Politically, our notions of virtue and vice have had another genesis.|Colin Campbell
11573|Jesus' ministry was clearly defined, and the alternatives to the illusion and temptations of the desert were spelled out. A choice was made--life abundant, full, and free for all. Make no mistake about it, the day that choice was made, Jesus became suspect. That day in the temple he sealed the fate already prepared for him.

11580|Play has been man's most useful preoccupation.|Frank Caplan
11581|It's as if we think liberation a fixed quantity, that there is only so much to go around.

Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be establishedat every level--there's little bargaining, a little give and take,but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward.

This is unpleasant for every man. Consequently every man does everything possible to postpone the date, and would sacrifice anything that he has if he could reverse the sentence. Practically all religions and all philosophies have started thus crudely, by promising their adherents some such reward as immortality. No religion has failed hitherto by not promising enough the present breaking up of all religions is due to the fact that people have asked to see the securities. Men have even renounced the important material advantages which a well-organized religion may confer upon a State, rather than acquiesce in fraud or falsehood, or even in any system which, if not proved guilty, is at least unable to demonstrate its innocence. Being more or less bankrupt, the best thing that we can do is to attack the problem afresh without preconceived ideas. Let us begin by doubting every statement.

It is through his letters alone that we learn about the dispensation of Grace, about Israel being set aside, with Jew and Gentile being saved into the Body of Christ. It was Paul who taught 'all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses' (Acts 2121). It was also Paul who proclaimed the forgiveness of sins 'to all who would believe' in Christ, adding that 'ye could not be justified by the law of Moses' (Acts 1338-39). The measuring rod of grace tells us that the age of Grace began with Paul, then continued through those who were saved and subsequently carried on His God-given doctrines of grace.|John Fredericksen

13164|The common dogma of fundamentalists is fear of modern knowledge, inability to cope with the fast change in a scientific-technological society, and the real breakdown in apparent moral order in recent years.... That is why hate is the major fuel, fear is the cement of the movement, and superstitious ignorance is the best defence against the dangerous new knowledge. ... When you bring up arguments that cast serious doubts on their cherished beliefs you are not simply making a rhetorical point, you are threatening their whole Universe and their immortality. That provokes anger and quite frequently violence. ... Unfortunately you cannot reason with them and you even risk violence in confronting them.

Before puberty the child's personality has not yet formed and it is easier to guide its life and make it acquire specific habits of order, discipline, and work after puberty the personality develops impetuously and all extraneous intervention becomes odious, tyrannical, insufferable. Now it so happens that parents feel the responsibility towards their children precisely during this second period, when it is too late then of course the stick and violence enter the scene and yield very few results indeed. Why not instead take an interest in the child during the first period|Antonio Gramsci

13946|When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.|Thich Nhat Hanh
13947|The true miracle is not walking on water or walking in air, but simply walking on this earth.|Thich Nhat Hanh

13951|Cultivate your curiosity. Keep it sharp and always working. Consider curiosity your life preserver, your willingness to try something new. Second, enlarge your enthusiasm to include the pursuit to excellence, following every task through to completion. Third, make the law of averages work for you. By budgeting your time more carefully than most people you can make more time available. Does the combination of curiosity, enthusiasm, and the law of averages guarantee success Indeed it does not ... Success in the final analysis always involves luck or the element of chance. Louis Pasteur grasped this well when he said that chance favors the prepared mind.|John W. Hanley
13952|We must determine whether we really want freedom--whether we are willing to dare the perils of...rebirth... For we never take a step forward without surrendering something that we may have held dear, without dying to that which has been.|Virginia Hanson

14007|Most of us have been taught about the need to appropriate by faith what is already ours through grace. We all desire to have more joy in our Christian life. The keys to experiencing joy are available to all of us. We need to understand the gospel of the grace of God as revealed to the Apostle Paul. Then as we put Paul's instructions into practice, we will come to know God experientially. This will cause us to know Him better which will cause us to want to obey more, and on and on it goes. Then as we learn and obey God and become focused on spiritual things instead of earthly things, we will become thankful for everything that God has provided for us in Christ. Knowledge, obedience, and thankfulness will then lead to abundant joy in our everyday life In the words of the old hymn Trust and obey, For there's no other way, To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.|David Havard

14015|A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said 'What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.' The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, 'What is the turtle standing on' 'You're very clever, young man, very clever,' said the little old lady. 'But it's turtles all the way down.'|Stephen William Hawking

14156|From one Soul of the Universe are all Souls derived. . .Of these Souls there are many changes, some into a more fortunate estate, and some quite contrary. . .Not all human souls but only the pious ones are divine. Once separated from the body, and after the struggle to acquire piety, which consists in knowing God and injuring none, such a soul becomes all intelligence. The impious soul, however, punishes itself by seeking a human body to enter into, for no other body can receive a human soul it cannot enter the body of an animal devoid of reason. Divine law preserves the human soul from such infamy. . .The soul passeth from form to form and the mansions of her pilgrimage are manifold. Thou puttest off thy bodies as raiment and as vesture dost thou fold them up. Thou art from old, O Soul of Man yea, thou art from everlasting.|Hermes

14247|Scientists are the easiest to fool. They think in straight, predictable, directable, and therefore misdirectable, lines.

14399|At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humour it is clearly of value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are claiming special privileges which should not be granted.|Eric Idle

14428|Happiness is not a reward-it is a consequence. Suffering is not a punishment-it is a result.|Robert Green Ingersoll
14429|A moment's thought shows that man's feeling of isolation has no foundation, biologically or sociologically. We grow out of the Universe, we are an expression of it. The iron in our blood comes from the high temperature fusion of stars. We constantly interact with our environment. The force of gravity keeps our feet upon the earth and has a vital effect upon our metabolism. The air we breathe comes form the seas and the leaves, and the sun allows the process to take place. Society gives us all that makes us human our culture, our symbols, our concepts and our values. Without society, the notion of the individual would have no meaning.|Paul Ingram

14452|Wounded vanity knows when it is mortally hurt and limps off the field, piteous, all disguises thrown away.

14462|Our flag is red, white and blue, but our nation is a rainbow-red, yellow, brown, black and white-and we're all precious in God's sight.|Jesse Louis Jackson
14463|If there are occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance, please forgive me. Charge it to my head and not to my heart.|Jesse Louis Jackson

The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost.|Kaleel Jamison

Those of you who are more robust and individual than others, will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself-educating your own judgement. Those that stay must remember, always and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this society.|Doris Lessing

15197||
15198|It was a love of the air and sky and flying, the lure of adventure, the appreciation of beauty.

15291|Men make the mistake of thinking that because women can't see the sense in violence, they must be passive creatures. It's just not true. In one important way, at least, men are the passive sex. Given a choice, they will always opt for the status quo. They hate change of any kind, and they fight against it constantly. On the other hand, what women want is stability, which when you stop to think about it is a very different animal.|Eric Lustbader

15359|Once you permit those who are convinced of their own superior rightness to censor and silence and suppress those who hold contrary opinions, just at that moment the citadel has been surrendered.

15368|We are born at the rise of the curtain and we die with its fall, and every night in the presence of our patrons we write our new creation, and every night it is blotted out forever and of what use is it to say to audience or to critic, 'Ah, but you should have seen me last Tuesday'|Michel MacLiammir

15468|So. The time has come for me to get my kite flying, stretch out in the sun, kick off my shoes, and speak my piece. 'The days of struggle are over,' I should be able to say. 'I can look back now and tell myself I don't have a single regret.' But I do. Many years ago a very wise man named Bernard Baruch took me aside and put his arm around my shoulder. 'Harpo, my boy,' he said, 'I'm going to give you three pieces of advice, three things you should always remember.' My heart jumped and I glowed with expectation. I was going to hear the magic password to a rich, full life from the master himself. 'Yes, sir' I said. And he told me the three things. I regret that I've forgotten what they were.|Arthur Marx

Perhaps we are beholding yet another break in the chain that links child to home.|Charles Mathias, Jr.
15495|The brown bag, of course, had its imperfections. While some kids carried roast beef sandwiches, others had peanut butter.

15540|What should we emphasize in our teaching We learn much from Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus. Paul mentored each and sent them out to the churches to encourage and instruct God's Children of Grace. Notice how often Paul uses the words 'command,' 'warn,' and 'remind' in his letters to Timothy and Titus. God wants us to be loving and gentle in the way we teach His children, but He also wants us to be strong, precise and decisive in what we declare. We are not 'asking' Christians to obey God's Word. We are 'telling' them what God commands. We have no special power in ourselves, but when we preach God's Word we have the 'Power' of God behind us Our preaching and teaching should be in the 'Power and Strength' of God. He gave us the responsibility and authority to declare His Word. We do it humbly, but we do it.|Mark McGee
15541|Paul's evangelistic mission was different from the Kingdom Apostles, but in many ways the same. The Kingdom Apostles preached Jesus the Messiah, ready to return to Israel and set up His Messianic Kingdom. From Israel, the Apostles, with Christ on David's Throne, were to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe everything Christ had commanded them. They would do that because all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to Christ. As we all know, that did not happen. It will happen in the future, but it has not yet happened. What has happened is that Christ revealed a Mystery through His Special Apostle Paul.|Mark McGee
15542|God loves the world. That's plain to see as we read His Word. Today, God loves the world through us, His Children of Grace. Christ is 'in' us and we are 'in' Christ. Christ is loving people and reaching out to them through us. He is making His appeal through us. He is reconciling people to Himself through us|Mark McGee
15543|We were lost and dead in sin. We were by nature objects of God's wrath. But God Loved us That Love caused Him to do something about our situation. God is rich in mercy, so He made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions. God acted on His Love for us and saved us by His Grace Grace is the result of the actions of His Love. The remarkable thing about His Grace is that He didn't ask us to do anything but believe Him. God didn't ask us to perform some great deed. He didn't demand obedience from us before He would save us. God made us alive with Christ 'even when we were dead in transgressions and sins.' God is showing the universe 'the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.' (Ephesians 27) God was Kind to us 'in' Christ because He Loved us.|Mark McGee

15548|To those who charge that liberalism has been tried and found wanting, I answer that the failure is not in the idea, but in the course of recent history. The New Deal was ended by World War II.

15554|God knows that a mother needs fortitude and courage and tolerance and flexibility and patience and firmness and nearly every other brave aspect of the human soul. But because I happen to be a parent of almost fiercely maternal nature, I praise casualness . It seems to me the rarest of virtues. It is useful enough when children are small.

15584|Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories We would be more alive if we did more of this, and, Life would be more lovely if we did less of that. Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away.|Peter McWilliams

15587|Acceptance is not a state of passivity or inaction. I am not saying you can't change the world, right wrongs, or replace evil with good. Acceptance is, in fact, the first step to successful action. If you don't fully accept a situation precisely the way it is, you will have difficulty changing it. Moreover, if you don't fully accept the situation, you will never really know if the situation should be changed.|Peter McWilliams

16890|In painting, as in the other arts, there's not a single process, no matter how insignificant, which can be reasonably made into a formula. You come to nature with your theories, and she knocks them all flat.|Auguste Renoir
16891|I've been 40 years discovering that the queen of all colors was black.|Auguste Renoir
16892|The work of art must seize upon you, wrap you up in itself and carry you away. It is the means by which the artist conveys his passion. It is the current which he puts forth which sweeps you along in his passion.|Auguste Renoir

16906|The true God is the unknown God to the natural man and also the unknowable God without His revelation in Christ. God is not only invisible to man's sight , but also to man's senses. In Christ is found a God who is near, who hears, who cares, who loves, and who saves. 'For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ' (2 Cor. 46) 'All things are delievered unto me of my Father and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father neither knoweth any man the Father, save the son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him' (Matt. 1127).|Eugene Reuweler

16935|When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.

16936|Don't overlook the importance of worldwide thinking. A company that keeps its eye on Tom, Dick, and Harry is going to miss Pierre, Hans, and Yoshio.|Al Ries
16937|As a sinner I could not please God, I could not neutralize or pay for my own sin. But when God justified me by His grace He went on record declaring me righteous. He didn't wave a magic wand and declare me to be innocent. His holiness would not permit it. A basis for declaring me righteous was needed. The ground upon which my justification is built is the substitutionary death of His son, Jesus Christ. The shedding of blood demonstrates the righteousness of God 'that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus' (Rom. 326 NKJV). What a marvelous plan Man's plan of salvation by good works is offensive to God and to anyone who has been saved by God's grace.|Larry Riemersma

17223|As we study the Word of God rightly divided we are to understand that God has arranged His dealings with mankind into two programs. We have His prophesied purpose and His secret purpose. Prophecy has to do with the earth and Christ's reign upon it during the millennial kingdom, while the Mystery concerns our exaltation with Christ in the heavenlies.|Paul Sadler
17224|Why Paul God already had called twelve apostles of the kingdom Although Judas had fallen in transgression, the seat of his apostolic office was filled by Matthias preceding the day of Pentecost. Insofar as Paul was unconverted at the time, he could not have possibly fulfilled the qualificatios set down by the Holy Spirit to be numbered with the twelve (Acts 121-26). Of course, there are many dispensationalists who would agree with this interpretation, but teach that God ordained Paul to be the thirteenth apostle of the kingdom. Perhaps you have heard the saying, 'They jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.' In other words, we have gone from bad to worse, which is certainly the case with this view. the number twelve is stamped throughout the pages of prophecy, thus eliminating the possibility of a thirteenth apostolic office (Matt. 1928 cf. Rev. 12-21). What logical explanation then can we give for Paul's apostleship Before the foundation of the world, God foreordained that He would raise up a new apostle to reveal His eternal purpose for the parenthetical age of Grace in which we now live. Hence, Paul says 'But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen Gentiles...' (Gal. 115.16). When God temporarily rolled up the building plans of prophecy and placed them aside, He made known a secret set of plans. With this program came a completely new set of blueprints. According to the counsel of His will, He had predetermined to call Paul as the masterbuilder of the project. So then, the instructions for our building program are found in Paul's epistles. Little wonder the apostles says 'I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.' (1 Cor. 310). It is essential to use Pauline constructio materials (grace doctrines), simply because someday soon the Building Inspector will examine our workmanship to determine if we followed His codes.|Paul Sadler
17225|It has been said that God's gift is also indescribable because of the grace by which it is given. God, who is rich in mercy, gave the world the gift of His dear Son while we were at enmity with Him. Paul says 'But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us' (Rom. 58). Therefore, in Him we are freely given all things redemption, forgiveness of sins, righteousness, peace, hope, wisdom and knowledge.|Paul Sadler

17227|As members of the Body of Christ, each of us have been endowed with a special measure of grace to use in His service. Paul develops this theme in Romans where he states 'For as we have many members in one Body, and all members have not the same office So we, being many, are one Body in Christ, and ever one members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether...ministry, let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth, on teaching Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth, with diligence he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.|Paul Sadler

17405|Defeated enemies in battle have to confess the superiority of their captors, but this does not give them citizenship in that country. This is why as ambassadors for Christ we beseech people to be reconciled to God by faith in Christ now. If they confess Him as Lord with a heart of faith--now, while the doors of salvation are wide open, they will be saved (Rom. 109,10). Later they are forced to confess His Lordship to vindicate Christ's righteous judgment of them and the worthiness of their eternal doom. Confession does not bring the confessor salvation. It is too late, for the 'accepted time' for salvation has forever passed.|Vernon Schutz

17407|To fight fear, act. To increase fear--wait, put off postpone.|David Joseph Schwartz
17408|The test of a successful person is not an ability to eliminate all problems before they arise, but to meet and work out difficulties when they do arise. We must be willing to make an intelligent compromise with perfection lest we wait forever before taking action. It's still good advice to cross bridges as we come to them.|David Joseph Schwartz

17414|Our institutions and values are in jeopardy as the mores of the market pervade all social life in this country. Loyalty, honesty, courage, discipline, patriotism, and commitment to family are being crowded out by the goals and rules of economic rationality -- do whatever makes the most money.|Barry Schwartz

17420|Beyond the formative effects of reading on the individuals composing society, the fact that they have read the same books gives them experiences and ideas in common. These constitute a kind of shorthand of ideas which helps make communication quicker and more efficient.

17431|In conclusion, there is a marvelous anecdote from the occasion of Russell's ninetieth birthday that best serves to summarize his attitude toward God and religion. A London lady sat next to him at this party, and over the soup she suggested to him that he was not only the world's most famous atheist but, by this time, very probably the world's oldest atheist. 'What will you do, Bertie, if it turns out you're wrong' she asked. 'I mean, what if--uh--when the time comes, you should meet Him What will you say' Russell was delighted with the question. His birght, birdlike eyes grew even brighter as he contempalated this possible future dialogue, and then he pointed a finger upward and cried, 'Why, I should say, 'God, you gave us insufficient evidence.'

17506|The galleries are full of critics. They play no ball, they fight no fights. They make no mistakes because they attempt nothing. Down in the arena are the doers. They make mistakes because they try many things. The man who makes no mistakes lacks boldness and the spirit of adventure. He is the one who never tries anything. His is the brake on the wheel of progress. And yet it cannot be truly said he makes no mistakes, because his biggest mistake is the very fact that he tries nothing, does nothing, except criticize those who do things.|David M. Shoup

If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.|John Swinton

18030|But those rare souls whose spirit gets magically into the hearts of men, leave behind them something more real and warmly personal than bodily presence, an ineffable and eternal thing.

18052|Nothing is quite so wretchedly corrupt as an aristocracy which has lost its power but kept its wealth and which still has endless leisure to devote to nothing but banal enjoyments.

18056|Whoever has inhabited the United States must have perceived that in those parts of the Union in which the Negroes are no longer slaves the have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites.

18057|...The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the Negroes in almost all the states in which slavery has been abolished, but if they come forward to vote, their lives are in danger... The same schools do not receive the children of the black and of the European. In the theaters gold cannot procure a seat for the servile race beside their former masters in the hospitals they lie apart... Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free Negroes are allowed to enter the territory of that state or to hold property in it.|Alexis Charles Henri Clrel de Tocqueville

18150|God does not judge us by the multitude of works we perform, but how well we do the work that is ours to do. The happiness of too many days is often destroyed by trying to accomplish too much in one day. We would do well to follow a common rule for our daily lives--DO LESS, AND DO IT BETTER.|Dr. Dale E. Turner
18151|Why is it that, as we grow older, we are so relunctant to change It is not so much that new ideas are painful, for they are not. It is that old ideas are seldom entirely false, but have truth, great truth in them. The justification for conservatism is the desire to preserve the truths and standards of the past its dangers, of which we are seldom aware, is that in preserving those values, we may miss the infinitely greater riches that lie in the future.|Dr. Dale E. Turner
18152|The test is to recognize the mistake, admit it and correct it. To have tried to do something and failed is vastly better than to have tried to do nothing and succeeded.|Dr. Dale E. Turner

18157|It is important to live each day with a positive perspective. It is not wise to pretend problems do not exist, but it is wise to look beyond the problem to the possibilities that are in it. When Goliath came against the Israelites, the soldiers all thought, 'He's so big, we can never kill him.' But David looked at the same giant and thought, 'He's so big, I can't miss him.'|Dr. Dale E. Turner
18158|The greatest of all faults is to be conscious of none. Recognizing our limitations and imperfections is the first requisite of progress. Those who believe they have arrived believe they have nowhere to go. Some not only have closed their minds to new truth, but they sit on the lid.|Dr. Dale E. Turner
18159|In all the work we do, our most valuable asset can be the attitude of self-examination. It is forgivable to make mistakes, but to stand fast behind a wall of self-righteousness and make the same mistake twice is not forgivable.|Dr. Dale E. Turner

18183|I learned...that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.|Brenda Ueland

18711|Have you even been in love Horrible, isn't it It makes you so vulnrable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses. You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' or 'how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.|Rose Walker

18792|No one imagines that a symphony is supposed to improve in quality as it goes along, or that the whole object of playing it is to reach the finale. The point of music is discovered in every moment of playing and listening to it. It is the same, I feel, with the greater part of our lives, and if we are unduly absorbed in improving them we may forget altogether to live them.|Alan B. Watts
18793|According to conviction, I am not simply what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost more the real me than what I am at this moment. For what I am seems so fleeting and intangible, but what I was is fixed and final. It is the firm basis for predictions of what I will be in the future, and so it comes about that I am more closely identified with what no longer exists than with what actually is|Alan B. Watts

18815|Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority.

They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.|Daniel Webster
18816|Failure is more frequently from want of energy than want of capital.|Daniel Webster
18817|If we work upon marble, it will perish if we work upon brass, time will efface it if we rear temples, they will crumble into dust but if we work upon immortal minds and instill into them just principles, we are then engraving that upon tablets which no time will efface, but will brighten and brighten to all eternity.|Daniel Webster

Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to insure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.|Roger Zelazny

20429|I am...blood. That primordial ooze. Not out there, listeners, in here. Inside this skin we wear, it only lets us think we're something else-- nice clean brains, little talking computers running around in the pursuit of happiness. We pierce this skin and what do we see Warm ooze, protoplasm churning and jesting, defecating, pulsating, life, death.|Robin Green

20432|Spring has sprung. We're free at last, people. Free at last. Thank you mother nature, we're free. Time to toss open that metaphysical window and check out that psychic landscape.

20436|Ladies and gentlemen, today we're here to honor electricity, the charge that charges everything from those electrons snapping in our brain to our father the sun. What's the sun It's kind of like a brain. Electromagnetic field, solar flares sparking back and forth from those nerve cells. We're all one, folks, giant blobs of electricity, all of us. Positive & negative, electromagnetic fields just circling each other. Positive, negative, north, south, male and female. Looking for that electric moment.

Not the river, not the wind, not even the Wolf. The Raven came and said The Wolf is hungry. If you stop talking, you'll hear him. The wind too. And when you hear the wind, you'll fly.

Pure centrifugal force. You can see yourself hurtling ass end over teakettle into oblivion.|Robin Green
20440|Dr. Joel Fleischman in nature. Not exactly the man you knew. He couldn't see past the Hudson River if he tried. He liked his fish smoked or preferable hand sliced from Zabars on a sliced bagel served with onions. Nature, to him, was an irritant. Birds didn't sing, they woke him up. A body of water wasn't life, it was a golf hazard..|Robin Green
20441|Time is just something that we assign. You know, past, present, it's just all arbitrary. Most Native Americans, they don't think of time as linear in time, out of time, I never have enough time, circular time, the Stevens wheel. All moments are happening all the time.|Robin Green

20463|One of the things that keeps you from dropping them in the nearest volcano is that you had to work too hard to get them.

20464|You're dealing with the demon of external validation. You can't beat external validation. You want to know why Because it feels sooo good.|Barbara Hall
20465|You're alive. Do something. The directive in life, the moral imperative was so uncomplicated. It could be expressed in single words, not complete sentences. It sounded like this Look. Listen. Choose. Act.|Barbara Hall
20466|It's funny, to me, the way people refer to childbirth as a miraculous event. A miracle is something that defies nature. Only, childbirth has got to be the most natural thing in the world. Top three anyway. But, on the other hand, when you think about it, there's really no other word that fits. Sperm. Egg. A coincidental meshing of genetic information that will grow something that could write an opera or cook up some Napalm. It blows my mind.|Barbara Hall

20470|Being plied with fine food always puts me in mind of the slammer, cause the food was jumpin' in there too--high in fat but nice and salty. You know what the worst deprivation in there was My music. Radio belonged to my cell mate, the Blonde Hammer. He was into that jazz-fusion thing at the time. I tell you what, enough Spyro Gyra and you're hoping you'll get killed in a knife fight.|Barbara Hall
20471|LEONARD I've failed, Chris. I can't locate the white collective unconscious. CHRIS I wouldn't feel too bad about that. You know, western culture hasn't really carried the baton on folklore and mythology. The rise of Christianity put the kibosh on it--the gospel hits the number one best-seller list and everything else gets remaindered.|Barbara Hall

21314|There isnt much better in this life than finding a way to spend a few hours in conversation with people you respect and love. You have to carve this time out of your life because you arent really living without it.|Real Live Preacher

21324|God, I dont have great faith, but I can be faithful. My belief in you may be seasonal, but my faithfulness will not. I will follow in the way of Christ.

21327|We think having faith means being convinced God exists in the same way we are convinced a chair exists.

21328|EVERY path may lead you to God, even the weird ones. Most of us are on a journey. Were looking for something, though were not always sure what that is. The way is foggy much of the time.

21337|You can't love anyone until you understand that you can't love everyone.|Real Live Preacher
21338|Forgiveness is the healing of wounds caused by another. You choose to let go of a past wrong and no longer be hurt by it. Forgiveness is a strong move to make, like turning your shoulders sideways to walk quickly on a crowded sidewalk. It's your move.|Real Live Preacher
21339|The universe seems wondrous to me, with or without God. It has powerful lines and uncompromising ways. Patience and time sit like sages on the planets, strong and impersonal. There is a stark beauty to all of this.|Real Live Preacher
21340|It really doesnt matter if the person who hurt you deserves to be forgiven. Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. You have things to do and you want to move on.|Real Live Preacher
21341|Forgiveness does not always lead to a healed relationship. Some people are not capable of love, and it might be wise to let them go along with your anger. Wish them well, and let them go their way.|Real Live Preacher
21342|Memory is a giggling sprite and will not be tamed. She takes flight the moment the present becomes the past.|Real Live Preacher
21343|One thing is clear to me. You cant know everything youd like to know. You cant do everything youd like to do. You cant read everything youd like to read.

21344|I hate life, I hate death and everything in between just doesn't interest me.|Chris Rapier
21345|There's something intrinsically therapeutic about choosing to spend your time in a wide, open park- like setting that non-golfers can never truly understand.|Charles Rosin

If those who are toiling for wealth to leave their children, would but take half the pains to secure for them virtuous habits, how much more serviceable would they be. The largest property may be wrested from a child, but virtue will stand by him to the last.|William Graham Sumner

21382|Pride is a powerful narcotic, but it doesn't do much for the auto-immune system.|Stuart Stevens
21383|There's a dark side to each and every human soul. We wish we were Obi-Wan Kenobi, and for the most part we are, but there's a little Darth Vadar in all of us. Thing is, this ain't no either or proposition. We're talking about dialectics, the good and the bad merging into us. You can run but you can't hide. My experience Face the darkness, stare it down. Own it. As brother Nietzsche said, being human is a complicated gig. Give that old dark night of the soul a hug Howl the eternal yes|Stuart Stevens

21385|Marriage. Why do we do it Everybody knows the stats. One in two marriages end up in broken dishes and a trip to Tijuana. Is it loneliness Partly. Is it teamwork Definitely. Things just kind of go easier when there's two of you. One of you can wait in line at the movie theater while the other guy parks the car. Get better seats that way. Better room rate when it's a double. Are you ready to file jointly...Above you is the sun and sky. Below you, the ground. Like the sun, your love should be constant, like the ground, solid.|Jed Seidel

21515|Any ordinary favor we do for someone or any compassionate reaching out may seem to be going nowhere at first, but may be planting a seed we can't see right now. Sometimes we need to just do the best we can and then trust in an unfolding we can't design or ordain.|Sharon Salzberg
21516|Life is like and ever-shifting kaleidoscope - a slight change, and all patterns alter.|Sharon Salzberg

21521|You've been listening to the adagio from Beethoven's 7th Symphony. I think Ludwig pretty much summed up death in this one. You know, he had lost just about all his hearing when he wrote it, and I've often wondered if that didn't help him tune into the final silence of the great beyond.|Andrew Schneider
21522|The fact that we don't know this man, isn't important really. Cause his experience is our experience, and his fate is our fate. Vani tass, vani tatum, et omni i vani tass, says the preacher. All is vanity I think that's a pretty good epitaph for all of us. When we're stripped of all our worldly possessions and all our fame, family, friends, we all face death alone. But it's that solitude in death that's our common bond in life. I know it's ironic, but that's just the way things are. Vani tass, vani tatum, et omni i vani tass. Only when we understand all is vanity, only then, it isn't.|Andrew Schneider
21523|I am going to concentrate on what's important in life. I'm going to strive everyday to be a kind and generous and loving person. I'm going to keep death right here, so that anytime I even think about getting angry at you or anybody else, I'll see death and I'll remember.|Andrew Schneider
21524|If you were in a burning house and there was a cat and a Rembrandt, what would you save The cat...you would save the cat, because the cat is alive. The art is dead. It's just paint on a canvas, ink on a page. To live for art is to deny life. It's just to destroy life.|Andrew Schneider
21525|There is nothing sadder in this world than the waste of human potential. The purpose of evolution is to raise us out of the mud, not have us grovelling in it.|Andrew Schneider
21526|We hold in our hands, the most precious gift of all Freedom. The freedom to express our art. Our love. The freedom to be who we want to be. We are not going to give that freedom away and no one shall take it from us|Andrew Schneider
21527|You bluffed me I don't like it when people bluff me. It makes me question my perception of reality.|Andrew Schneider
21528|Men are confused. They're conflicted. They want a woman who's their intellectual equal, but they're afraid of women like that. They want a woman they can dominate, but then they hate her for being weak. It's an ambivalence that goes back to a man's relationship with his mother. Source of his life, center of his universe, object of both his fear and his love.|Andrew Schneider
21529|People are simply incapable of prolonged, sustained goodness.|Andrew Schneider
21530|It's no accident that the church and the graveyard stand side by side. The city of the dead sleeps encircled by the city of the living.|Andrew Schneider
21531|The day is coming, and it ain't going to be long, when you ain't even gonna have to leave your living room. No more schools, nor more bodegas, no more tabernacles, no more cinneplexes. You're going to snuggle up to your fiber optics baby and bliss out.|Andrew Schneider

21535|If you're going to be a healer, it's not enough to read books and learn allegorical stories. you need to get your feet wet, get some clinical experience under your belt.|Andrew Schneider
21536|Death is the enemy. I spent 10 years of my life singlemindedly studying, practicing, fighting hand to hand in close quarters to defeat the enemy, to send him back bloodied and humble and I am not going to roll over and surrender.|Andrew Schneider
21537|Life here is so elemental. So real. Without the interference of civilization you can really experience things like,...silence. Silence and darkness in its purity. Right now, right outside my window all I can see is a black void. Endless darkness. It's totally exhilarating, and I feel very lucky to be here. Very, very lucky.|Andrew Schneider
21538|Well, you're either lovers or you're wanting to be lovers or you're trying not to be lovers so you can be friends, but any way you look at it, sex is always looming in the picture like a shadow, like an undertow.|Andrew Schneider
21539|Life is everywhere. The earth is throbbing with it, it's like music. The plants, the creatures, the ones we see, the ones we don't see, it's like one, big, pulsating symphony.|Andrew Schneider
21540|Life's dirty. Life's unclean you know. It's birth, it's sex, it's the intestinal tract. One big squishy, unsanitary mess. It never gets any cleaner either. You know, dust to dust, worms crawl in, worms crawl out, right Even though we know that, we still walk the walk, we still live the life. We're like a bunch of little kids. Little kids, you know, we jump in this big old pond of mud and we're slapping it all over our face, rubbing our hair all down our backs and we're making these glorious, gooey, mud pies. That's us.|Andrew Schneider
21541|Weird, isn't it Somehow in the dead of winter when its 40 below, so cold your words just freeze in the air, you think you'll never hear a robin's song again or see a blossom on a cherry tree, when one day you wake up and bingo, light coming through the mini blinds is softened with a tick of rose and the cold morning air has lost its bite. It's spring once again, the streets are paved with mud and the hills are alive with the sound of mosquitos.|Andrew Schneider
21542|I feel like I can handle a lot of things. I can handle a parasitic infection and separating lesions, arterial sclerosis. But this stuff...I just want to go through life thinking people are happy, naive as that may sound.|Andrew Schneider
21543|It's just human. We all have the jungle inside of us. We all have wants and needs and desires, strange as they may seem. If you stop to think about it, we're all pretty creative, cooking up all these fantasies. it's like a kind of poetry.|Andrew Schneider
21544|Time for the weather report. It's cold out folks. Bonecrushing cold. The kind of cold which will wrench the spirit out of a young man, or forge it into steel.|Andrew Schneider
21545|But then there's a moment like tonight, a profound and transcendent experience, the feeling as if a door has opened, and it's all because of that instrument, that incredible, magical instrument.|Andrew Schneider
21546|There were always people like the pope. They serve a certain function, of course. They subsidize us. But, they don't create anything and they must never be allowed to stop the artist from creating.|Andrew Schneider
21547|They didn't need men because they had each other, a significant other. It doesn't matter if the cat's in pants or pedal-pushers. I don't think we're supposed to fly solo.|Andrew Schneider
21548|Hey, what do you think drives all this grey matter up here Electricity. It's brain waves surfing on synaptic junctions. If your radio can go out because of sun spots, why can't your cerebellum It's all a matter of reception and it seems to me these signals are going to get crossed somehow. It's all logical.|Andrew Schneider
21549|Marriage is the union of disparate elements. Male and female. Yin and yang. Proton and electron. What are we talking about here Nothing less than the very tension that binds the universe. You see, when we look at marriage, people, we're are looking at creation itself. I am the sky, says the Hindu bridegroom to the bride. You are the earth. We are sky and earth united.... You are my husband. You are my wife. My feet shall run because of you. My feet shall dance because of you. My heart shall beat because of you. My eyes see because of you. My mind thinks because of you and I shall love because of you.|Andrew Schneider
21550|Trees like to have kids climb on them, but trees are much bigger than we are, and much more forgiving.|Andrew Schneider
21551|Marriage. It's a hard term to define. Especially for me--I've ducked it like root canal. Still there's no denying the fact that marriage ranks right up there with birth and death as one of the three biggies in the human safari. It's the only one though that we'll celebrate with a conscious awareness. Very few of you remember your arrival and even fewer of you will attend your own funeral.|Andrew Schneider
21552|Ever since we crawled out of that primordial slime, that's been our unifying cry, More light. Sunlight. Torchlight. Candlight. Neon, incandescent lights that banish the darkness from our caves to illuminate our roads, the insides of our refrigerators. Big floods for the night games at Soldier's field. Little tiny flashlights for those books we read under the covers when we're supposed to be asleep. Light is more than watts and footcandles. Light is metaphor. Light is knowledge, light is life, light is light.|Andrew Schneider
21553|Despite everything I've achieved in my life, the culinary awards, the military commendations, the honorary degrees, I have never, ever lost sight of what's truly important. The thing that gives meaning to these triumphs. Someone to share them with. A companion. A help mate. A wife.|Andrew Schneider
21554|I just have this feeling if I take pi, well past all this static, take pi to 10 million, 20 million digits, that I'll find something really incredible. Not just a pattern, not just an order, but a sign. A mathematical sign.|Andrew Schneider
21555|I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't think you can measure life in terms of years. I think longevity doesn't necessarily have anything to do with happiness. I mean happiness comes from facing challenges and going out on a limb and taking risks. If you're not willing to take a risk for something you really care about, you might as well be dead.|Andrew Schneider
21556|A person has three choices in life. You can swim against the tide and get exhausted, or you can tread water and let the tide sweep you away, or you can swim with the tide, and let it take you where it wants you to go.|Andrew Schneider
21557|Continuous unremitting darkness has been known to send some people into an emotional tailspin, so the management here at KBHR radio suggests locking away the firearms. The desire to stick that 45 between the teeth can get pretty strong at times, so why invite temptation.|Andrew Schneider
21558|Real meaningful endeavours, the biggies in human existence, often require the sacrifice of others.|Andrew Schneider
21559|I used to think of all the billions of people in the world, and of all those people, how was I going to meet the right ones The right ones to be my friends, the right one to be my husband. Now I just believe you meet the people you're supposed to meet.|Andrew Schneider
21560|As a doctor, as a man of science, I can tell you there is no such thing as curses Everything just happens as a question of probability. The statistical likelihood of a specific event.|Andrew Schneider
21561|I'm grateful to you. If it weren't for you, I'd be in Cicely right now and I'd still be running that rat race, still locked in that commute. I'd be totally stressed, I'd be totally ignorant of what my life could be. I'm happier now than I've ever been.|Andrew Schneider
21562|There can be no spirituality, no sanctity, no truth without the female sex.|Andrew Schneider
21563|I always admired atheists. I think it takes a lot of faith.|Andrew Schneider
21564|She gave me more than just a sweater vest that night. She gave me all this. Nothing. She gave me nothing. That's what I need. No phone book, no Game Boy, no pasta maker, TV Guide. Nowhere to go, nothing to do.|Andrew Schneider
21565|Sometimes the mind, for reasons we don't necessarily understand, just decides to go to the store for a quart of milk.|Andrew Schneider
21566|Marriage. It's like a cultural hand-rail. It links folks to the past and guides them to the future.|Andrew Schneider
21567|The vow of silence, that's the mind-blower. See, talking is what I do... i t's a real need with me, a craving, I'm like a word junkie. I never shut up. I talk to myself, I talk in my sleep. The idea of voluntarily turning off that tap, I can't imagine it It'd be like, I don't know, all the rivers in the world just slammed to a stop. No churning, no flowing, no white water, just stillness, crushing stillness. I don't think I could stand it, locked up like that in my own psyche. I'd collapse into myself, I'd implode|Andrew Schneider
21568|What are man and woman if not members of two very different and warring tribes Yet decade after decade, century after century, they attempt in marriage to reconcile and forge a union. Why I don't know. Biological imperative Divine law Or just a desire to connect to that mysterious other In any case, it's always struck me as a hopeful thing.|Andrew Schneider
21569|Listen, can you hear it Spring's sweet cantata. The strains of grass pushing through the snow. The song of buds swelling on the vine. The tender timpani of a baby robin's heart. Spring.|Andrew Schneider
21570|Greetings on this most exceedingly beautiful spring morning. A morning swollen with new life, a morning on which, if I had the voice, I would let loose with song. It's hard to believe just a few short weeks ago we were eating our cornflakes in the wintery dark. Now, well it's still kind of dim out there, but I can see the golden glow of Apollo's chariot waiting in the wings, about to make its entrance. Winter's on the lam, no doubt.|Andrew Schneider
21571|Let's not kid ourselves. Whatever we diagnose, most patients, if they don't die, get well by themselves. Our job is mainly to try to make them feel better do no harm.|Andrew Schneider
21572|As a scientist, I am not sure anymore that life can be reduced to a class struggle, to dialectical materialism, or any set of formulas. Life is spontaneous and it is unpredictable, it is magical. I think that we have struggled so hard with the tangible that we have forgotten the intangible.|Andrew Schneider

In real life there are no fogbound moors or clues on matchbooks or fifth columnists waiting to be unmasked. it would be nice if here were, because then there would be solutions to things in life, but it doesn't always work that way. Everyone likes a good detective story. I went through my Hammett phase in college. I think the attraction is, in life our mysteries aren't exciting. You know They're just intractable and depressing and enervating. Like, why do we always hurt the ones we love. Where does the money go ...in a detective story, at least the universe makes sense.

21720|Dateline Mesopotamia, 3500 B.C. That's when the multi-faceted sounds we call music got its humble beginnings. It seems clappers were sent out the the fields to scare evil spirits away.

Every moment of your life is lived for the future --you go to high school so you can go to college so you can get a good job so you can get a nice house so you can afford to send your kids to college so they can get a good job so they can get a nice house so they can afford to send their kids to college.|John Green

It is so hard to leave---until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.|John Green

22206|The pursuit of happiness" is an American myth. The ideologies and governments of this century that promised happiness, have left people with more material possessions, but less psychological well-being. Many of the citizens are emotionally bankrupt and unhappy. The demands of life in our current socioeconomic system require that we keep running and running with little or no breaks....Like their parents, most of the young professionals will drift through life racing for the "American Dream", going through very expensive trial-and-error lessons and struggling to achieve happiness and fulfillment.|Med Jones

22221|No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space.

22228|It was a world which granted privileges to some and imposed prohibitions on others...Endowed with strength and eager to learn, one had to drag himself in a narrow prison cell when he could see an open field, a vast horizon in the distance; when he could feel the beatings of a heart; and when he believed himself entitled to enjoy the beauty of a dream.|Dr. Jose P.

22241|He who knows the surface of the earth and the topography of a country only through the examination of maps..is like a man who learns the opera of Meyerbeer or Rossini by reading only reviews in the newspapers. The brush of landscape artists Lorrain, Ruysdael, or Calame can reproduce on canvas the sun's ray, the coolness of the heavens, the green of the fields, the majesty of the mountains...but what can never be stolen from Nature is that vivid impression that she alone can and knows how to impart--the music of the birds, the movement of the trees, the aroma peculiar to the place--the inexplicable something the traveller feels that cannot be defined and which seems to awaken in him distant memories of happy days, sorrows and joys gone by, never to return!|Dr. Jose P.

22248|Fame to be sweet must resound in the ears of those we love, in the atmosphere of the land that will guard our ashes.

22737|We must never forget, that under modern conditions of life, science, and technology. All war has been greatly brutalized, and that no one who joins in it, even in self-defense, can escape becoming also in a measure brutalized. Modern war cannot be limited in its destructive method and the inevitable debasement of all participants A fair scrutiny of the last two World Wars makes clear the steady intensification of the weapons and methods employed by both, the aggressors and the victors. In order to defeat the Japanese aggression, we were forced, as Admiral Nimitz has stated, to employ a technique of unrestricted warfare, not unlike that which 25 years ago was the proximate cause of our entry into World War I. In the use of strategic air power the Allies took the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Germany and Japan. We as well as our enemies have contributed to the proof that the central moral problem is war and not its methods, and that a continuance of war will in all probability end with the destruction of our civilization.|Henry Stimson

23157|Today's society has decided it's better to assume, deceive or lie to ourselves to spare our own feelings. When accepted the truth will set us free. Anything aside from that will torment us.
